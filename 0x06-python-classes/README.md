# 0x06-python-classes

This repository contains Python code files related to the topic of classes. It includes various files that demonstrate the use of classes and objects in Python.

## Files:

- `0-square.py`: A Python file that defines an empty class `Square`.

- `1-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.

- `2-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with a getter and setter for the `size` attribute.

- `3-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with methods to calculate the area and print the square.

- `4-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with a customized string representation.

- `5-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with methods to calculate the area and print the square using the `print()` function.

- `6-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with methods to calculate the area, print the square using the `print()` function, and check if two squares are equal or not.

- `100-singly_linked_list.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Node` to represent a node in a singly linked list, and a class `SinglyLinkedList` to represent the linked list itself.

- `101-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with methods to calculate the area, print the square using the `print()` function, and compare two squares based on their areas.

- `102-square.py`: A Python file that defines a class `Square` with methods to calculate the area, print the square using the `print()` function, and compare two squares based on their areas and positions.

- `103-magic_class.py`: A Python file that defines a class `MagicClass` with a single method `magic_method` that performs various mathematical operations.

Feel free to explore the code files for more details and examples on how to work with classes in Python.
