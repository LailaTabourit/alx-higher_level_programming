0x08-python-more_classes and Objects
This repository contains solutions to the problems related to the topic "More Classes and Objects" in Python. Each problem is solved using the concepts of classes and objects, allowing for a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming in Python.

Problem Descriptions
The repository includes the following problem descriptions:

Rectangle: A class that represents a rectangle and includes methods to calculate the area and perimeter, and to print the rectangle with the '#' character.

Sqaure: A class that inherits from the Rectangle class and represents a square. It includes methods to calculate the area and print the square with the '#' character.

String representation: A class that represents a rectangle and overrides the __str__ and __repr__ methods to change the default string representation of the object.

Eval is magic: A class that represents a rectangle and overrides the __str__ and __repr__ methods to change the default string representation of the object. It also overrides the __eq__ method to compare two Rectangle objects.

Detect instance deletion: A class that represents a rectangle and includes a method to print a message when an instance of the class is deleted.

How many instances: A class that represents a rectangle and includes a class variable to keep track of the number of instances created.

Change representation: A class that represents a rectangle and includes a class variable to keep track of the symbol used to print the rectangle.

Compare rectangles: A class that represents a rectangle and includes methods to compare rectangles based on their areas and perimeters.
